  /* 1.Overload the + operator which receives a string and returns a new person with a nickname
   2.Add an age to the Person class with default 0 value and add unary + operator and
   returns a new person with the age + 1
   e.g +mary => mary's age is incremented
  3.Add a learns method in the Person class =>
  "Mary learns Scala" for e.g
  Add a learnsScala method which calls learns with Scala
  parameter. Use it in postfix notation.
  4. Overload the apply to receive a number
  and return "Mary watched her favourite movie ... n times.
